# Python Guess The Number 🎯

A simple command-line number guessing game written in Python.

---

## Description

This project is a small CLI game where the user must guess a secret number.

It was built to practice:

- Python fundamentals  
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)  
- User input handling  
- Clean variable naming  
- Git and Conventional Commits workflow  

This repository will be incrementally improved as part of my Python development practice.
